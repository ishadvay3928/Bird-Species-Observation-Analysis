# 🐦 Bird Species Observation Analysis Project

This project delivers a **comprehensive end-to-end data analysis** of bird species distribution across **forest and grassland habitats** using **Python** and **Power BI**. It uncovers insights into species diversity, habitat preferences, observer activity, and environmental influences such as temperature, humidity, and sky conditions.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

* Study bird species distribution and diversity across habitats
* Identify habitat preferences and environmental factors influencing bird presence
* Determine peak observation times for fieldwork and eco-tourism
* Highlight dominant and rare species for targeted conservation efforts
* Recognize top observers to motivate accurate and consistent data collection
* Provide actionable insights for biodiversity conservation and eco-tourism planning

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno)** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis
* **Power BI** – 3-page interactive dashboard with slicers, KPIs, and visual storytelling
* **Excel Data** – Forest and Grassland bird monitoring datasets across multiple administrative sites

---

## 🗃️ Data Workflow

### 1. Data Loading

* Combined **Forest** and **Grassland** Excel sheets into pandas DataFrames
* Explored structure, duplicates, and missing values
* Mapped **Admin Unit Codes** (e.g., ANTI, CATO, CHOH) to ecological sites

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* ✅ Dropped low-utility columns (e.g., `Sub_Unit_Code`)
* ✅ Imputed missing values (`Unknown`, `Undetermined`, or `Mode`)
* ✅ Cleaned and standardized time fields into `Observation_Hour`
* ✅ Converted categorical columns to efficient datatypes
* ✅ Removed duplicates to ensure integrity
* ✅ Saved cleaned dataset as `Bird_Monitoring_Clean_Merged_dataset.csv`

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Habitat & sex distribution
* Top 10 observed bird species
* Distance distribution of sightings
* Observer activity & recognition
* Hourly & temporal observation trends
* Environmental influences (temperature, humidity, sky, wind)

## 📊 Dashboard Overview (Power BI)

The **3-page interactive dashboard** visualizes key biodiversity and observation insights:

### 📈 Page 1: Overview

* **KPIs**: Total Observations, Unique Species, Total Observers
* **Visuals**: Map of sites, Top 10 species, Observations by location type & time

### 🐦 Page 2: Species & Conservation

* **KPIs**: Unique Species, Identification Methods, Sex Distribution
* **Visuals**: Species diversity across habitats, ID method distribution, Top species by flyover

### 🌍 Page 3: Temporal & Environmental

* **KPIs**: Avg. Temperature, Avg. Humidity, Initial 3-Minute Observations
* **Visuals**: Observation trends by hour, sky condition, wind distribution, humidity vs distance

---

## 🔎 Key Insights

### 🌱 Habitat & Biodiversity

* Forests accounted for **55.6%** of observations; Grasslands **44.4%**
* Dominant species: **Northern Cardinal** & **Carolina Wren**
* Many species showed strong habitat preference (e.g., Red-eyed Vireo in forests)

### ⏰ Temporal Patterns

* Bird activity peaked between **6–7 AM**
* Grassland activity more consistent throughout the morning

### 👥 Observer Insights

* **Elizabeth Oswald** recorded the highest number of observations
* Observers contributed more in forests than in grasslands

### 🌦 Environmental Trends

* Most sightings occurred at \~**22°C**, high humidity, and partly cloudy skies
* Light breezes (1–3 mph) dominated wind conditions
* Sex was undetermined in **79%** of cases, suggesting training gaps

---

## ✅ Recommendations

* Improve **data quality** → reduce undetermined sex entries via better observer training
* Diversify **ID methods** (not only singing; add visualization and calls)
* Standardize **distance records** to avoid “Unknown” entries
* Conduct **fieldwork strategically** between **6–8 AM**
* Prioritize **forest habitats** but monitor underreported grasslands
* Recognize and support **top observers** for motivation
* Align eco-tourism activities with **favorable weather (\~22°C, partly cloudy, light breeze)**

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The Bird Species Observation Analysis project demonstrates how raw observational data can be transformed into **valuable biodiversity insights**. From species diversity to environmental dependencies, the findings inform conservation strategies, optimize eco-tourism activities, and highlight opportunities for better data collection practices. The **Power BI dashboard** enhances storytelling, making insights actionable for conservationists, researchers, and policymakers.
